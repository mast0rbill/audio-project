# Audio Project

Implemented using Processing in Java, this audio-based project includes two elements:

- InputTest takes an mp3 clip and performs Fast Fourier Transform on it to extract the amplitude of the sound wave at various frequencies, displaying it graphically.

- OutputTest allows the user to specify a note sequence and plays it using a custom wave function to simulate a plucked string instrument.
